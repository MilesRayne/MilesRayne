# Hi, I'm Miles! ðŸ‘‹
My actual name is MiloÅ¡, but years of gaming taught me that Miles was way easier to use and remember for most people. Call me whatever you prefer.
## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Full Stack Engineer, currently working as an Assistant Back End Team Lead at [Blinking](https://blinking.id).
I also work part-time as a Full Stack Engineer at [ProudSourceIT](https://proudsourceit.com/).
## ðŸ›  Skills

My primary strength definitely lies on the back end.

My preferred stack is Vue, NestÐˆS and PostgreSQL, but I've also built applications using frameworks and technologies such as Angular, Express, MySQL and others. Love TypeScript.

I dabble with DevOps stuff from time to time, so I have some experience in using Docker, Jenkins, AWS, ...

Although I love coding, I'm passionate about management and planning.
