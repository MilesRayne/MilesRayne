# Hi, I'm Miles! 👋
My actual name is Miloš Rajković, but years of gaming taught me that Miles Rayne is way easier to use and remember. Call me whatever you prefer, really!
## 🚀 About Me
I'm a Full Stack Engineer, currently working as an Assistant Back End Team Lead at [Blinking](https://blinking.id).
I also work part-time as a Full Stack Engineer at [ProudSourceIT](https://proudsourceit.com/).

I enjoy challenging tasks and creating new projects from scratch! Although I love coding, I'm passionate about management and planning.
## 🛠 Skills

My primary strength definitely lies on the back end.

My preferred stack is Vue, NestЈS and PostgreSQL, but I've also built applications using frameworks and technologies such as Angular, Express, MySQL and others. TypeScript is simply amazing! 🤩

I dabble with DevOps stuff from time to time, so I have some experience in using Docker, Jenkins, AWS, ...
