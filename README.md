# Hi, I'm Miles! ðŸ‘‹
My actual name is MiloÅ¡, but years of gaming taught me that Miles was way easier to use and remember for most people. Call me whatever you prefer.
## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Full Stack Engineer, currently working as the Back End Team Lead at [Blinking](https://blinking.id).
I also work part-time as a developer at [ProudSourceIT](https://proudsourceit.com/).
## ðŸ›  Skills
My preferred stack is Vue, NestÐˆS and PostgreSQL, but I've also built applications using frameworks and technologies such as Angular, Express, MySQL and others. Love TypeScript. Have worked shortly in Java and C# in the past, but heavily prefer JavaScript.

I dabble with DevOps stuff from time to time (using Docker, Jenkins, AWS, and the like...)

Although I love coding, I'm also passionate about management and planning.

A complete list of my skills can be found on [my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yTOcrKftUifWNG7Z1_Y2DUcIdDPhdJJo/view).
