# Hi, I'm Miles! ðŸ‘‹
My actual name is MiloÅ¡ RajkoviÄ‡, but years of gaming taught me that Miles Rayne is way easier to use and remember. Call me whatever you prefer, really!
## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Full Stack Engineer, currently working as an Assistant Back End Team Lead at [Blinking](https://blinking.id).
I also work part-time as a Full Stack Engineer at [ProudSourceIT](https://proudsourceit.com/).

## ðŸ›  Skills

I'd say my primary strength definitely lies in the back end.

My most preferred stack is Vue, Nest and PostgreSQL, but I've also built applications using frameworks and technologies such as Angular, Express, MySQL and others.

I dabble with DevOps stuff from time to time, so I have some experience in using Docker, Jenkins, AWS, ...
