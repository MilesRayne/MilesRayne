# Hi, I'm Miles! ðŸ‘‹
My actual name is MiloÅ¡, but years of gaming taught me that Miles was way easier to use and remember for most people. Call me whatever you prefer.
## ðŸš€ About Me
### Work
I'm a software engineer with somewhat over 4 years of experience in the industry, currently working as the back-end tech lead at [Blinking](https://blinking.id).
I also do work as an on-call developer at [ProudSourceIT](https://proudsourceit.com/).
### Education
Finished my undergraduate and graduate studies in Information Systems and Technologies at the [Faculty of Organisational Sciences](http://www.fon.bg.ac.rs/), in Belgrade, Serbia.
### Interests
I enjoy creating scripts, small apps and browser extensions and various other tiny software.
I love digital art and a long time ago I used to create stuff using drawing tablets. Nowadays I can't seem to find the time, but I still regularly use Photoshop to create smaller scale designs.

Sometimes I also do video-editing, which started off as something I did as a designer for [a student's organisation I was part of](https://fonis.rs/), as well as helping my dad with [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KameromkrozSrbiju). Always wanted to be more efficient with Premiere, but somehow never moved on from Vegas.
## ðŸ›  Technicals
Love TypeScript. Have worked shortly in Java and C# in the past, but heavily prefer JavaScript.
I'm interested in learning Go and I ocassionally dabble with Rust (although only to make Tauri apps).
My preferred technologies are NestÐˆS, PostgreSQL and Vue, but I've also built applications using Angular, Express, MySQL and others. 

A strong believer in NestJS and opinionated frameworks in general - I think most IT companies, made up of employees with various knowledge and experience levels, would benefit greatly from well-supported and widely accepted opinionated frameworks, rather than trying to reinvent the wheel for businesses that (in most cases) do not require this kind of innovation.

I dabble with DevOps stuff from time to time (using Docker, kubernetes, pm2, Jenkins, playing with AWS, etc.), but I usually do it only to provide assistance to the existing DevOps team in the company I work for.

Although I love coding, I'm also very passionate about management and planning, so I'm hoping to climb the management ladder further in the future and move away from programming as my full-time job. Programming is way more fun as a hobby.
